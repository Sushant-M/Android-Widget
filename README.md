# Android-Widget
First attempt at making a widget.
The idea is, there'll be a fact or tip for the game clash of clans, this will change every day at random.

Picks out a random integer within the constraints of the array containing the facts, display the indexed array in the widget, update every 1/2 hour.

Was weekend practice
